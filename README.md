# ToDoListPython
A python program using Tkinter to keep track of all of your tasks.

When the program is run, 4 tabs will open.

```First Tab```: Percentage counter - keeps track of what percentage of all of your tasks you have done.

```Second Tab```: Information - gives you instructions on how to use the app. 

```Third Tab```: Completed Tasks - whenever you complete a task, it is moved to this tab.

```Fourth Tab```: To-Do List - the actual running list of all of your tasks, along with an add and remove button.
